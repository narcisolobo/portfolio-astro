          I&lsquo;m a full-stack developer and educator with a front-end focus
          and a love for accessible, inclusive design. I&lsquo;ve been building
          for the web for over 20 years and teaching for the last five — helping
          learners from all backgrounds grow through programs like Coding Dojo,
          Chicago Codes, and WOS. I&lsquo;m the founder of CisoCodes, a
          curriculum studio focused on uplifting underserved communities through
          tech.

        <p class="mb-4 font-sans">
          React, Next.js, .NET, and Flask are my daily tools. Music, mentorship,
          and perfect Lighthouse scores keep me inspired.

          I&lsquo;m also a theatre major, Chicago sports fan, and cancer
          survivor — living in LA with my Sheepadoodle Jinja and an attitude of
          gratitude.
